# CyberCavs-Scouting-System

*A.K.A. CCSS because every good project needs a cool acronym.*

&nbsp;

The CyberCavs Scouting System is a collection of applications and tools designed to enhance the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) scouting experience. The CCSS was created, and is maintained by [FRC team 4678 CyberCavs](https://www.cybercavs.com/) students, mentors, and alumni and was designed specifically for the needs of the CyberCavs. That being said, due to it's customizable and flexible nature, it is our hope that that the CCSS may be a useful tool for other FRC teams as well.

&nbsp;

The goal of the CCSS is to
- eliminate paper scouting,
- eliminate manual data entry, and
- enable teams to easily create their own data formats and data collection interfaces

All while
- not requiring users to have technical skills such as coding knowledge,
- not requiring teams to poses dedicated scouting equipment such as tablets, and
- generally being of no cost to the teams using it

&nbsp;

The primary components are listed below:

- GameMaker: A Windows and Mac application enabling the creation of custom data formats and data collection interfaces.

- DataHost: A web server to host the data collection interface definitions and event schedules.

- ScoutingApp: A cross-platform mobile scouting app.

- DataCollector: A tool for transfering data from scouting devices to a central database.
