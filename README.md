# CyberCavs-Scouting-System

*A.K.A. CCSS because every good project needs a cool acronym.*

&nbsp;

The CyberCavs Scouting System is a collection of applications designed to enhance the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) scouting experience. The CCSS was created, and is maintained by [FRC team 4678 CyberCavs](https://www.cybercavs.com/) students, mentors, and alumni and is designed specifically to fit the needs of the CyberCavs. That being said, due to it's customizable nature, it is our hope that that the CCSS may be a useful tool for many FRC teams.

&nbsp;

The goal of the CCSS is to
- eliminate paper scouting,
- eliminate manual data entry, and
- enable teams to easily create custom data collection interfaces and schemas.

All while
- not requiring users to have technical skills such as coding knowledge,
- not requiring scouts to have internet connection or cell service at competitions,
- not requiring teams to possess dedicated scouting equipment such as tablets, and
- being of no cost to the teams using it.

&nbsp;

The components of the CCSS are listed below:

- GameMaker: A cross-platform desktop app enabling the specification of custom data collection interfaces and schemas.

- EventMaker: A cross-platform app enabling the specification of Event rosters and match schedules.

- SpecHost: A web server to simplify the distributing of Game and Event specifications when network connectivity is available.

- ScoutingApp: A cross-platform app that displays the scouting interface based on the game specifications and generates QR codes containing the scouted data.

- DataScanner: A cross-platform mobile app that scans the QR codes in order to centralize the scouting data on a single device.

- DataIngester: A tool for transfering data from scouting devices to a central database.

- DataViewer: A cross-platform app for querying, displaying, and comparing the collected data.

&nbsp;

The CCSS was first conceptualized in late 2019 with the intention of using it in the 2020 FRC season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic development of the CCSS was abandoned in early 2020. Development restarted in fall 2022 and the CyberCavs intend to use a beta version of the CCSS in the 2023 FRC season. The CyberCavs intend on releasing the CCSS to the public in 2024.
