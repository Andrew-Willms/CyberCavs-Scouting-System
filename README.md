# CyberCavs-Scouting-System

*A.K.A. CCSS because every good project needs a cool acronym.*

&nbsp;

The CyberCavs Scouting System is a collection of applications designed to enhance the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) scouting experience. The CCSS was created, and is maintained by [FRC team 4678 CyberCavs](https://www.cybercavs.com/) students, mentors, and alumni and is designed specifically to fit the needs of the CyberCavs. That being said, due to it's customizable nature, it is our hope that that the CCSS may be a useful tool for many FRC teams.

&nbsp;

The goal of the CCSS is to
- eliminate paper scouting,
- eliminate manual data entry, and
- enable teams to easily create custom data collection interfaces and schemas.

All while
- not requiring users to have technical skills such as coding knowledge,
- not requiring users to have internet connection or cell service,
- not requiring teams to poses dedicated scouting equipment such as tablets, and
- generally being of no cost to the teams using it.

&nbsp;

The primary components are listed below:

- GameMaker: A cross-platform desktop app enabling the specification of custom data collection interfaces and schemas.

- DataHost (working title): A web server for hosting and distributing these specifications.

- ScoutingApp: A cross-platform mobile app that generates scouting interfaces based on the specifications.

- DataIngester (working title): A tool for transfering data from scouting devices to a central database.

- DataViewer (working title): A cross-platform app for querying, displaying, and comparing the collected data.
